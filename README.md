### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Po and I'm currently on a 850hr Full Stack bootcamp. 

I was actually a VB and VB.NET developer in FinTech 13 years ago but I decided to quit the rat race and become a certified language trainer to adults learning English as a second language. Now I'm hoping to combine the skills and knowledge I have gained in both fields for what comes next. I'm ready for a new challenge! :sweat_smile:
